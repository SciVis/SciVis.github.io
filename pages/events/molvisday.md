We are happy to announce the Molecular Visualization Day taking place at the [Visualisering Center C](https://visualiseringscenter.se/en) in Norrköping on the 16th of March 2023 from 11:00 to 16:00.

The focus of the day is to present our recent progresses regarding molecular visualization to the researchers of the domain. In particular, we are now able to visualize Molecular Dynamics in the dome theater of the Visualization Center C here in Norrköping. This provides a unique opportunity for domain scientist to present their work in an immersive environment. 
  
To illustrate this feature, we will have the chance to hear a keynote lecture by [Professor Erik Lindahl](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/erik-lindahl/) that will integrate MD visualization in the dome.
  
In the second part of the day, all participants are welcome to present their own molecular simulation. To do so, please check the box in the registration form and upload your data together with a short description using the link provided. Preferred format for the trajectory include pdb, gro+xtc. The time per presenter (about 10-15 minutes) will depend on the number of submissions.
