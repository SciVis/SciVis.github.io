# Welcome to the Molecular Visualization Day!

We are happy to announce the Molecular Visualization Day that will take place at the [Visualisering Center C](https://visualiseringscenter.se/en) in Norrköping the 16th of Mars from 10:30 to 16:00.

The point of the day is to present our recent progresses regarding molecular visualization to the researchers of the domain. In particular, we are now able to visualize Molecular Dynamics in the dome which gives a unique opportunity for domain scientist to present their work in an immersive environment. 
  
To illustrate this feature, we will have the chance to hear a keynote lecture from [Professor Erik Lindahl](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/erik-lindahl/) that will integrate MD visualization in the dome.
  
In a second part of the day, all participants are welcome to present their own molecular simulation. the time by presenter (10-15 minutes) will depend on the number of submissions.
  
Please follow this link for registration.
  
The organizaing Committee: Robin Skånberg, Alexei Abrikosov, Alexander Boch and Mathieu Linares
