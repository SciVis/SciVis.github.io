Increasing internet speeds and advances in compression techniques have enabled the ability to perform remote rendering of complicated graphics scenes while streaming the video and input between a light-weight terminal and a rendering cluster.  One potential use-case for this technique is the ability to provide high-school students with lower-power hardware but still enable them to run demanding hardware (in this case OpenSpace) to learn about the universe. Another use-case is the display of large, time-varying datasets that might be too costly to transfer to the end user.  An example of this are the MHD simulations performed by partners at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/), who would place an interactive widget on the webpage allowing visitors to their webpage to interact with the datasets remotely without needing to download the full datasets.
Interesting questions arise from the fact that the OpenSpace user interface is already written in React, which enables a unique combination of WebRTC-streamed video with a local webpage.
