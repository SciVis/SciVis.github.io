Volume dataset acquired with a CT or MR scanner often look very bland when visualized using volume rendering. This can be attributed to the fact that material properties are not taken into account. For example, different types of tissue, e.g. bone, blood vessels, muscles, etc., have different optical properties like color, shininess, and light absorption. These need to be considered to produce high-quality and realistic-looking results.
In this project, you will investigate ways of how to design and assign material properties to matching tissue types. This will then be integrated into an existing volume rendering framework in the second part of the project. This project requires programming in C/C++ and OpenGL. Some background in computer graphics and volume rendering is advantageous.
