The OpenSpace software is used with great success in collaborative immersive environments, but the support for head-mounted display is as of yet underutilized.  The usage of virtual reality headsets provides a much more immersive experience to users that would be vastly beneficial for the general public (for example to be able to experience the real-world scale of planetary surfaces) as well as astronomy scientists when interacting with their datasets in an intuitive way.
The goal of this thesis work is to develop the HMD-capabilities of the software to be able to show all available astronomical data in a virtual reality headset and provide the user with an intuitive interface that can be navigated using the HMD's controllers.  This includes integrating the OpenVR framework (or some other open-source solution that can support multiple types of HMD vendors) into the OpenSpace rendering pipeline and designing an interaction paradigm that is suited for astronomy.  An interesting question for this work is how to design the user interface so that it is non-obstrusive for the content and how to seamlessly navigate between objects in the entire universe and to design a method of navigation that would work without any fixed reference points (for example when travelling from the Earth to Mars).
