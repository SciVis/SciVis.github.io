Molecular orbitals specify the spatial distribution of electrons in a molecule. 
Using software tools like VeloxChem, these orbitals can be computed as a scalar 
function on a grid enclosing the molecule. Isosurface visualization is the 
standard method of visualizing these orbitals. However, currently the computation 
of the volumetric representaion of orbitals is slow which does not allow for 
interactive visualization. 

The goal of this project is to implement a tool for intercative 3D visualization of 
molecular orbitals. Achieving interactivity will require implementaion of a faster 
approximate molecular orbital computation algorithm which has been developed in-house. 
This tool is meant to be used by theoretical chemists who are more 
familiar with Python-based tools and interfaces. So, our aim will be to develop 
a visualizer compatible with Jupyter Notebook. This project will require familiarity 
with Python in addition to knowledge of C++ and OpenGL.
