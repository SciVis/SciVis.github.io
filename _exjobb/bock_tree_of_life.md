We are engaged in a multidisciplinary project that brings astrophysics and bioinformatics datasets and techniques together through data visualization. We will examine and communicate high quality gene barcode sequences for 50,000 species within a three-dimensional, immersive realm using OpenSpace. Collaborators in Basel, Switzerland have curated the DNA dataset, and will collaborate to synthesize these data into a sensible 3-D representation that is informed by science.

This work will involve applying clustering algorithms to these data, importing to, and experimenting within, OpenSpace to find the most effective ways to visualize these data, and building tools within OpenSpace to highlight the stories that these data reveal. The result will be an informative visualization experience that is easy to grasp for the publicâ€”in essence, a 3-D tree of life that reveals the relationship between species. The engaged masters student(s) will be immersed in both computational biology and astrophysical content. Our goal is to recruit 1-2 students for the project to work directly with scientists at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.
