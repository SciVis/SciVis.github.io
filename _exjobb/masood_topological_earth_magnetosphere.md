The magnetic field of the Earth (the magnetosphere) changes constantly due to its interaction
with material ejected from the Sun. Analysis of this magnetic field is of vital importance as it
protects life on Earth as well as our satellite assets in space from deadly solar and intergalactic
radiation. So far, only rudimentary methods have been used to analyse the behavior of the
magnetic structure over time and particularly topological methods have thus far not found their
way into the day-to-day workflow of the domain experts. Detailed 4D (3D + time) vector field
simulations are readily available, prepared by the CCMC, which can provide valuable insight
into the behavior of Earth's magnetosphere.
The goal of this project is to explore existing topological methods and apply these to the 4D
simulations. Much research has been done on extracting features in 2D, but in many aspects,
there remains work to be done for 3D vector fields. One possible avenue is to detect extreme
points in the vector field and use these as seed points for fieldline rendering that can provide a
visual representation of the different topological structures in the dataset. Another possible
approach is to reconstruct boundary surfaces and visualize these directly. In the course of this
thesis work, a variety of methods shall be tested and evaluated with the goal of extending the
existing OpenSpace application to provide a useful tool for the domain scientists at the
Community Coordinated Modeling Center.
