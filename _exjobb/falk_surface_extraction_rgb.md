Large full-color volume datasets of tissue samples often contain three-dimensional structures hidden inside the otherwise dense data. The form and shape of structures like blood vessels or cavities are usually of particular interest. 
In this project, you will investigate methods to extract surfaces from such data. This project requires programming in C/C++ and OpenGL. Some background in computer graphics and volume rendering is advantageous.
