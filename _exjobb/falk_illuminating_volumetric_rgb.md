With today's microscopes it is possible to acquire large-scale full-color volume datasets where each voxel holds a color value. Shading and illumination can provide important depth cues to better comprehend the structures hidden within the volume.
Your task is to investigate methods for illuminating colored volumetric data. Of particular interest are real-time methods for large-scale data without precomputation. This project requires programming in C/C++ and OpenGL. Some background in computer graphics and volume rendering is advantageous.
