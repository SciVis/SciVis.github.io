The crystal structures of new materials are of particular interest in the field of material science. The dense three dimensional data originates from simulations and different visualizations are used for inspection and to gain insight.
In this project, you will investigate visualization techniques for enhancing the spatial understanding of this crystallographic data and whether additional data can provide more detail, for example embedding information on atoms and bonds. This project requires programming in C/C++ and OpenGL.
