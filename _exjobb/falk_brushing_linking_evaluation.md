When exploring new datasets, one often uses multiple views and visualizations at the same time. These views are typically linked, that is when performing a selection in one view this is reflected in all others. Finding appropriate sets of selection and filtering primitives across different views and fulfilling user expectations can be challenging. 
The task of this project is to evaluate and categorize different primitives (selection of points, lines, rows, columns, etc.) in linked visualizations. It involves prototyping various data visualizations using existing frameworks like D3 or Vega and linking them. This project requires programming in Javascript or similar for prototyping.
