This exjobb thesis is a continuation of work conducted 2 years ago ([link](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1530782/FULLTEXT01.pdf)) and is located at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.  The Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute is one of the world-leading visualization research laboratories and has been a long-standing partner in the OpenSpace Project.

One of the important aspects of OpenSpace is the ability to provide astronomy and astrophysics researchers with the tools to bring their data and findings to the public.  There have been a few areas in which this has been accomplished in OpenSpace, but this thesis aims at solving the problem on a larger scale by improving the integration with other astronomical analysis tools, particularly two called "Aladin" and "Glue".  These tools are very widely used by astronomers to analyze datasets and visualize them, however they are lacking the tools to show the results in an immersive 3D environment.  The previous thesis work made great success in the direction of visualizating point-like data sources by implementing a custom protocol to enable data transfer between Glue and OpenSpace, but much remains to be done.

The goal of this exjobb is to work closely with astronomical researchers using their expertise to improve on the existing implementation.  Of particular interest here are the support for additional data types (for example volumetric data sets), time-varying data, and the ability to have the system work in a planetarium/powerwall environment.  In the end it will be possible for the experts to analyze datasets in any tools of their choosing and use Glue and Aladin as an interface to directly visualize the results in OpenSpace.  This will open up uses of the softwares to the whole scientific community and be highly impactful.
