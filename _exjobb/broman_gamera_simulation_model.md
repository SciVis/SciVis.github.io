This is a project that will be carried out by 2 students as a master thesis project. This opportunity will be carried out within the software OpenSpace for the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) team at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

##### Background

The magnetic field of the Earth (the magnetosphere) changes constantly due to its interaction with the Sun's magnetic field. Analysis of Earth's magnetic field is of vital importance as it protects life on Earth as well as our satellite assets in space from dangerous solar and galactic radiation. Simulation of our magnetosphere can be done in various ways with different simulation models. These models all base their simulation inputs on solar wind observations at the L1 Lagrange point between the Sun and the Earth.

The solar wind and magnetic field of the Sun extends throughout the solar system and beyond.  This is called the heliosphere.  At the Earth, when the Sun's magnetic field interacts with the Earth's magnetosphere, magnetic reconnection occurs.  Tracing and visualizing magnetic field lines is therefore very important for analysis.  Scientific visualizations of simulations of Earth's magnetosphere are mostly done with contour plots of 2D slices, either movies or still cut planes. The color contour plots show simulation parameters such as speed, pressure, temperature and magnetic field with field lines overlaid. 

##### The project
One of the magnetospheric simulation models is called GAMERA, Grid Agnostic MHD for Extended Research Applications. This project will be about incorporating this model, and visualizing its output in OpenSpace, with mentoring from the model developer Dr. Slava Merkin. This entails investigating how best to pipeline it all, from the end of the simulation run, to storing data, interpreting it and visualizing it in OpenSpace.

OpenSpace has rendering support of field lines and cut planes and more already in place. Additions to the renderables are expected with support of GAMERA and its native grid. This may include implementing file converters/readers, interpolation, and more. OpenSpace is mainly developed using C++ and OpenGL.
