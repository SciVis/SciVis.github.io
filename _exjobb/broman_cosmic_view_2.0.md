We are engaged in a multidisciplinary project that brings astrophysics and bioinformatics datasets together through data visualization. We will examine and communicate high quality gene barcode sequences for 50,000 species within a three-dimensional, immersive realm using OpenSpace. Collaborators in Basel, Switzerland have curated the DNA dataset via dimensionality reduction methods, and will collaborate to synthesize these data into a sensible 3-D representation that is informed by science.
 
This work will involve discovering new methods and techniques to visualize these data. The project will involve an intimate knowledge of these data sets, discerning which aspects are critical for storytelling, and devising new visualization techniques around those aspects. This could also include building tools within OpenSpace to highlight these data and stories. The internship will culminate in a public program in the planetarium to showcase these data — which, in essence, is a 3-D tree of life that reveals the relationship between species. Our goal is to recruit one student to continue the work started on this project in January 2022 by previous Masters students from Linköping. The student will directly work with scientists at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and alongside fellow Linköping students working on a complimentary Astrophysics project in OpenSpace.

This project requires familiarity with C++ and OpenGL. Some background/interest in computer graphics and visualization methods is advantageous.
