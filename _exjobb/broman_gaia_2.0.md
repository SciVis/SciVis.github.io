Gaia is a revolutionary observatory from the European Space agency that has cataloged the distances, motions and fundamental parameters of almost 2 billion stars.  Gaia data provides a multi-dimensional view of the Milky Way in unprecedented detail.  Examining subsets of the catalog provides an opportunity to examine the structural cohesiveness of the Galaxy, the diverse chemical history, and the velocity evolution over time.  Ingesting and visualizing this dataset is a data analysis challenge with rewards both for public dissemination and scientific advancement.  A former Masters student from Link√∂ping successfully employed an octree data structure to visualize the Gaia catalog and with this thesis we aim to build upon that fruitful project. 
 
We seek two students to work on a complimentary thesis improving upon the ingestion and visualization of Gaia data. One student's primary responsibility will be to focus on representing the stars by their inherent characteristics (e.g. color, temperature, luminosity).  Additionally, we want the stars to visually look more accurate and be commensurate with the other star catalogs within OpenSpace. This portion of the thesis will largely revolve around developing computationally efficient visualization techniques for a massive dataset of stars. The second student's primary responsibility will be to focus on reviewing the current process and code for importing Gaia data into OpenSpace, removing any scientific analysis from that process, and making the pipeline more flexible by working with a variety of file formats and multi-file ingestion scenarios. Work will be necessary to refine the scripts that build the octree and the parameters that produce an octree that strikes a balance between visual accuracy and computational limitations. Both students will work in New York City at the American Museum of Natural History with data scientists and astrophysicists. 

This project requires familiarity with C++. For the rendering part, an interest/background in computer graphics is advantageous.
