# Visualization research for real world solutions
I am a visualization researcher who focuses on developing fundamental concepts that find their application in real world solutions. I am passionate about the communication of science to both laymen and experts. I am the proud leader of a large research division with great people and have the privilege of being the director of a visualization center with research, education, innovation and public engagement as an agenda.

# Research Projects
I am involved in a large number of research projects ranging from low level computer graphics to applied visualization. Applications of my research are found in diverse areas such as medical visualization, astrophysics, autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, and visual learning and communication.

# Talks
I often present our research at conferences and am frequently invited to give keynotes at research conferences. I also give popular science talks on a range of topics related to my research and motivational talks about science and leadership to a general audience.
