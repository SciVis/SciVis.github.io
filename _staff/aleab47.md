I have a PhD in chemistry from Lund university during which I preformed multi-scale simulations of nanoparticle self-assembly driven by anisotropic interactions. After my PhD studies I stayed in Lund for a year and did a project developing and optimizing atomistic description of concrete by the means of statistical and quantuum methods. Currently I am interested in topological analysis of electronic charge density.
