# Research interests
After receiving my Masters degree from Linköping University in 2016, I started a position as Research Engineer for the open source visualization software Inviwo, primarily developed by the Scientific Visualization group at Media and Information Technology, LiU. Subsequently, I switched to a PhD position to further pursue my academic interests.

Coming from a background in languages, I have a keen interest in transporting the question of how to beautifully encode intent and information from spoken to visual language.
Synonymously, this task becomes more engaging, the more complex the message/data is. Will say, I am tackling the challenge of conveying complex data that is not intuitively comprehensible, and application-driven exploration of high-dimensional, high-order data.

Therefore, my research focuses specifically on tensor field exploration, and feature space exploration and analysis.

# Ongoing projects
We are currently investigating several ways to expand on the concept of Feature Level-Sets. Stay tuned for interesting outcomes! Apart from that, I have started composing my dissertation. Working title: *See it through*.
