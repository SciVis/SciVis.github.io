In 2011 I received my Diploma (Dipl.-Ing.) in Computational Visualistics from the Otto-von-Guericke University in Magdeburg, Germany. Shortly after, I took the opportunity for a research stay at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia, where I was living for two years.

Subsequently, I worked in the Virtual Reality and Scientific Visualization group of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Braunschweig, Germany. Here, I had the technical lead of a three year EU funded project, CROSS DRIVE which started in January 2014 and united best European expertise in the fields of planetary research and Mars science, Virtual Reality, atmospheric science and research as well as rover mission planning.

Since Summer 2017 I am employed as a PhD Student in the group for Scientific Visualization at Media and Information Technology, LiU. My main research interest are flow visualization, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
