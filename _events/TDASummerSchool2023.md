Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has become an established framework for the extraction and analysis of hidden structural features in complex data with applications to a wide variety of scientific domains including quantum chemistry, astrophysics, fluid dynamics, combustion, material sciences, biology, and data science. The genericity, efficiency, and robustness of topological methods have made them particularly well suited for the multi-scale, interactive analysis and visualization of the structural information of data.

With the aim to broaden the participants' knowledge in TDA, its application to visual data analysis, and exposure to available software tools, we are organizing a summer school at Norrköping, Sweden during Aug 21-25, 2023. The primary target group of this summer school is Ph.D. students, post docs, and master's students working in this field. For the program, we plan to have lectures by invited speakers in the morning, a short session of presentations from participants after lunch, and hands-on sessions with different software packages (including TTK, Paraview, Inviwo) in the afternoon. 
 
The registration is free of cost, but the participants will need to arrange and pay for travel and accommodation themselves. Note that we have limited number of seats available. 

This event is sponsered by [Swedish e-Science Research Centre (SeRC)](https://e-science.se) and [Vetenskapsrådet](https://www.vr.se/).

## Topics

The tentative list of topics we aim to cover during this summer school include:

- Mathematical foundations: manifolds, Morse functions, complexes, persistent homology, ... 
- Topological analysis of scientific data: scalar, vector, tensor, and multi-field topology 
- Feature-based visualization with topological descriptors: comparison, tracking, uncertainty, ...  
- Visual representations of topological descriptors
- Algorithms in computational topology 
- Applications and case studies 
- Software packages for TDA and visualization

## Travel grant 
  
The organizers have decided to offer full financial support for travel and accomodation of *one student*. To apply for this opportunity, a student should send an email to [ingrid.hotz@liu.se](mailto:ingrid.hotz@liu.se?subject=Summer School Travel grant:) with a letter of recommendation from their supervisor clearly specifying the student's merit, relevance of this summer school to the student's research, and justification of unavailibility of any other source of funding for this visit.
