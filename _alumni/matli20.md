Mathieu Linares obtained his PhD in Theoretical Chemistry at the Paul Cézanne University (Marseilles, France) in 2005, where he developed a valence bond method under the supervision of Prof. S. Humbel. In 2006, he joined the Laboratory for Chemistry of Novel Materials in Mons (Belgium) for a post-doctoral
stay where he worked on the modeling of self-assembly in solution and at surfaces. He then worked as postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Physics group at Linköping University (Linköping, Sweden) with Prof. S. Stafström (2008-2009) and in the group of Theoretical Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm, Sweden) with Prof. Hans Ågren (2010). He currently hold an associate Professor position in the group of scientific visualization at Linköping University (Linköping, Sweden). Appart from molecular visualization, his main research interests are chirality, self-assembly in solution and on surface, charge transport in organic materials.
